Hi! My name is Veri, a software engineer/product guy living in Jakarta, Indonesia.

I got my bachelor degree from [Institut Teknologi Bandung](https://itb.ac.id) in 2012, majoring in Information System and Technology. Then, I continue my master study at [Toyohashi University of Technology](https://tut.ac.jp) (Computer Science and Engineering, 2014) with research in Natural Language and Processing. Here are the list of my published paper:

- [Indonesian Automatic Speech Recognition System Using English-based Acoustic Model](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6021583)
- [Effect of Captioning Lecture Videos for Learning in Foreign Language](https://ipsj.ixsq.nii.ac.jp/ej/?action=pages_view_main&active_action=repository_view_main_item_detail&item_id=94554&item_no=1&page_id=13&block_id=8)
- [Automatic Speech Recognition and Machine Translation System for MIT English Lectures using MIT and TED Corpus](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9144/f458e7d197323055db618f721d67941c1feb.pdf)
- [English to Japanese Spoken Language Translation System for Classroom Lectures](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7005911)

I love new technologies and often find myself tinkering with them during my spare time. Currently, I'm focusing on web development, especially server-side development using mainly JavaScript with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and a little bit of [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/). I also do frontend development using [React](https://reactjs.org/).

Other than coding, I also love to play futsal/football, reading self-improvement books, or just strolling around places with my beautiful wife.
