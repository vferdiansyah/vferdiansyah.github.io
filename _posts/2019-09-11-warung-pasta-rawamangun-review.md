We visited this restaurant for late lunch after our doctor visit last month. I was craving for some pasta, and there's a Warung Pasta branch not far from the hospital so we decided to go there.

## Review

### Caesar Salad

Ordered Caesar Salad for our appetizer since my wife really love salad. The taste is just right. We love it even though it lacks crouton which in my opinion, gonna make it taste better.

### Curly Swirly

This is what I order since I never tried their baked pasta. It was pretty good! Even though it's cheese-based, it's not too overwhelming for me so I can finish it just fine. Overall, I'll order it again if I visit Warung Pasta again.

### Spicy Hot Pasta

This is what my wife ordered. She loved it! She loves the tom yum taste.

### Pisang Coklat Keju Susu Pizza

We ordered this for dessert ðŸ˜†. Just kidding. My wife is still not full so we ordered this pizza. This pizza is actually can be served as dessert. Crunchy and sweet!

### Lemon Tea

Just your regular lemon tea, nothing strange or special about it.

## Verdict (3/5 :star:)

We quite liked it. And it's nearby our hospital too so we'll definitely re-visit the place if I crave for pasta again since other pasta places are quite far.
