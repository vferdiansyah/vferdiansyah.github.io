title:  Blu Cheese Tea Review

A couple days ago, my wife was craving for some bobba tea at night. When I look through [Gojek](https://www.gojek.com/) app, I found a bobba cafe named Blu Cheese Tea not far from our apartment.

We ordered their Cloud Duo (M). Originally, we want it to be Cloud Bobba Milk Tea and Cloud Bobba Fresh Milk. But since they said they ran out of milk tea üò¢, we got 2 Cloud Bobba Fresh Milk instead.

## Review

### Packaging

Their packaging is quite cute actually. I love the square character.

### Taste

For me, the taste was just average. There are other places that have better taste with the same or even lower price point. But for my wife, she loved it. She said it's really good. She just loves bobba I guess.

## Verdict (3/5 ‚≠êÔ∏è)

I would only buy their product again when my wife is craving for it since there are still **A LOT** of better options out there.
